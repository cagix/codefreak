In Code FREAK, assignments and tasks can be defined YAML files. This includes the configuration of automated evaluation.

[[assignment]]
== Assignment

An assignment is defined by a directory (or packaged archive) containing a `codefreak.yml` with the following schema.

[cols="1,1,3"]
.Assignment Object
|===
|Field Name |Type |Description

|title
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** The name of the assignment.

|tasks
|`[string]`
|List of paths to <<task,task definitions>> (relative to the assignment).
|===

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
title: My Assignment
tasks:
  - my-task-1
  - my-task-2
----

.Corresponding file structure
----
├─ codefreak.yml
├─ my-task-1
│  ├─ codefreak.yml
│  ├─ main.c
├─ my-task-2
│  ├─ codefreak.yml
│  ├─ ...
├─ ...

[[task]]
== Task

A task is defined by a directory (or packaged archive) containing source code files and a `codefreak.yml` with the following schema. The `codefreak.yml` will be excluded from the source code files.

[cols="1,1,3"]
.Assignment Object
|===
|Field Name |Type |Description

|title
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** The name of the task.

|description
|`string`
|Detailed instructions for students. Basic markdown is supported.

|hidden
|[`string`]
|Patterns of files that should be hidden from students. Matching files are only included for evaluation. If matching files are created by students, they are ignored for evaluation.

|protected
|[`string`]
|Patterns of files that should be read-only. Students will be able to see matching files but modifications are ignored for evaluation. Non-existent files can be protected to prevent their creation.

|evaluation
|Map[string, <<evaluation,Evaluation Step Object>>]
|Map of key to an evaluation step object. They key acts as unique identifier for the evaluation step within this task.
|===

TIP: File patterns use the Ant pattern syntax. For more information refer to the https://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns"[official documentation].

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
title: My Task
description: Write a function `add(int a, int b)` that returns the sum of `a` and `b`
hidden:
  - src/test/**
  - .codeclimate.yml
protected:
  - build.gradle
  - settings.gradle
evaluation:
  my-step:
    title: My first check
    script: |
      echo "Hello World"
    report:
      format: default
----

[[evaluation]]
== Evaluation

Automatic evaluation consists one or more steps
Each step consists of a script that evaluates the code and a report parser, that will parse the result into a list of feedback.
An evaluation step is defined as follows.

.Evaluation Step Object
|===
|Field Name |Type |Description

|script
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** A (bash) script that will be executed for evaluation.

|title
|`string`
|An optional human readable name for the evaluation step. Summarize briefly for your students what this evaluation step checks (e.g. "Test functions.py", "Class XYZ Tests", "Code Style", ...).

|timeout
|`integer`
|An optional custom timeout in seconds after which the evaluation step will be canceled and marked as failed. There is a system-wide default timeout of 5min.

|report.format
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** The id/key of one evaluation report parser that will try to parse the result into a list of feedback. See xref:for-teachers:evaluation.adoc#report-parsers[Report Parsers] for a list of currently supported parsers.

|report.path
|`string`
|A path or matching-pattern for a file that will be read by the report parser. If a blank path is specified the console output will be passed to the report parser.
