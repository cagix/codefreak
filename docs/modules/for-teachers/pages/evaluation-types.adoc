= Types of Evaluation

Code FREAK allows running automated evaluation on answers. There are different types of evaluation that each serves a different purpose. The evaluation types are also called *runners*. Each runner is configurable to fit most needs when examining source code.

The following is just an **overview** about the runners. For details on configuration please check out the xref:for-teachers:definitions.adoc[configuration definition reference].

== [[junit]] Unit/Functional Testing (`junit`)
This type of runner is useful for performing predefined unit tests on students source code. The junit-Runner performs tests by running a command and analysing a resulting jUnit XML file. This format can be generated by various unit-testing frameworks for different languages like:

* https://junit.org[jUnit] (Java)
* https://jestjs.io/[Jest] (JavaScript)
* https://docs.pytest.org/[pytest] (Python)
* https://github.com/google/googletest[Google Test] (C++)
* https://phpunit.de/[PHPUnit] (PHP)

These are just examples. Your favourite testing-tool might be able to generate jUnit compliant XML, too!

The `junit` runner will execute one or multiple commands in the container and afterwards look for jUnit XML files. The XML files then will be parsed and imported as <<feedback,Feedback>>.

*Example Configuration*:

The following example contains the default configuration for the `junit` runner. It uses the https://hub.docker.com/_/gradle[official `gradle` Docker image] and runs the `gradle test` command on the source code in `/home/gradle/project`. After execution the runner will look for `TEST-*.xml` files in the `results-path` directory.

      results-path: build/test-results/test
      commands:
        - gradle test

=== Environment Variables
During evaluation of the answer the same dynamic environment variables as for the `commandline` runner ar available. See <<cli-environment-variables, Commandline Environment Variables>>.

== [[codeclimate]] Static Code Analysis (`codeclimate`)
The static code analysis runner is currently based on https://codeclimate.com/[Code Climate]. Code Climate is a very powerful and extensible tool that gives helpful insight on issues in source code.

By default Code Climate runs some so called https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/advanced-configuration#section-default-checks[_Default Checks_]. In addition there are a lot of plugins for different languages and purposes. You can find a list of Plugins https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/list-of-engines[here] in the official documentation.

Code Climate is configured by using an external `.codeclimate.yml` or `.codeclimate.json` file. This file has to be included in the task boilerplate code but can be hidden by the `codefreak.yml` configuration. You can find the full configuration reference https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/advanced-configuration[here].

*Example Configuration*

The following configuration simply runs the `codeclimate` step with default settings. In addition there is a `.codeclimate.yml` file alongside the source code that is hidden for students. The configuration enables the https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/sonar-java[`sonar-java`] plugin â€“ an industry standard code analysis tool.

.codefreak.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
hidden:
  - .codeclimate.yml
evaluation:
  - step: codeclimate

..codeclimate.yml

plugins:
  sonar-java:
    enabled: true

== [[commandline]] CLI Commands (`commandline`)
The commandline runner allows to perform basic evaluations and examines the exit-code of shell-commands. The evaluation step is only successful if the exit-code of all commands is `0`. With this runner you could check e.g. for existing directories or files.

NOTE: Currently, the CLI commands are *not* executed in a shell-session. This means you cannot rely on variables or results from previous commands.

*Example Configuration*

The following example configuration checks with the https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/test-invocation.html#test-invocation[test] utility if the directory `/home` exists. This will either return the exit-code `0` if it exists or `1` if it does not exist (or is no directory).

.codefreak.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
evaluation:
  - step: commandline
    options:
      image: ubuntu
      commands:
        - /usr/bin/test -d /home
----


== [[comments]] Comments (`comments`)
The comments runner is a placeholder currently. Comments are always possible and *don't* have to be enabled in configuration.

Comments are not added by runners but can be added by teachers via the UI. Open the Answer page of a submission and click the `+` button next to the line number of a file.
